                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello there! I'm Jaswanth Varma, a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Hailing from Visakhapatnam, India, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering before embarking on my current academic journey.
Currently, I am pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Information Technology Management at Illinois Tech. This program offers me the opportunity to delve deeper into the evolving world of technology and expand my expertise in managing and leveraging IT systems for impactful solutions.

Fueled by my passion for technology and continuous learning, I have gained hands-on experience through various internships and projects. My background includes CRM product testing with Selenium, Java programming, and automation tools, which have enriched my technical skills and prepared me for complex challenges.

This course, ITM, is a significant milestone in my academic career. It provides me with a comprehensive foundation in advanced web development, project management, and IT strategies. I am particularly excited about exploring cutting-edge technologies and innovative approaches to solve real-world problems through technology.</p>
